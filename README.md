<h2>Face Recognition and Detection</h2>
<h3>Using Haar Cascades Algorithm and DeepFace Library</h3>
<h5>This is a Face detection and recognition script that I wrote. I use the Haar Cascades algorithm, which is commonly used in machine learning object detection. The .xml file used is a pretrained model that works efficiently and quickly. It processes each frame and classifies each window as positive or negative where positive represents something belonging to what we are looking for while negative implies the opposite. This model's accuracy depends on the angle of the face compared to the camera. Since we are using the frontal face version minimal angles result in the highest accuracy. Following this, I use the DeepFace library to compare reference images taken of the user with what the camera is seeing. This library allows access to another pretrained model boasting a strong accuracy.
